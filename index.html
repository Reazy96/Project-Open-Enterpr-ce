              It’s the early days, you just had a long conversation with two friends about a meaningful challenge

              You’ve bootstrapped and delivered an MVP, and some investors and advisors are interested in having a
              chat with you. As an Open Enterprise, you can onboard them seamlessly into your digital organization
              and align them with your success.

              You need talented people on-demand across various tasks that your full-time workforce can’t
              prioritize at the moment. As an Open Enterprise, you can easily fund tasks and have people apply to
              work on them in return for funds or shares.
